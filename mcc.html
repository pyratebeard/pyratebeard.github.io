<p>Melksham Comic Con is a not-for-profit organisation, started in 2013 between a group of comic geek friends.  Our convention was created to try and bring our passion to others, a convention for the fans, by the fans.</p>
<p>I have helped organise and work the convention every year.  After the first year I took on the website responsibilities as my primary duty.  Now I am a Director on the Board and the Technical Officer.</p>
