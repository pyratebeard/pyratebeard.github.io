#### Part Two
The writing of this post has taken longer than originally anticipated. Primarily due to not finding a lot of time to sit and write. Over the last few months I have moved country and changed jobs twice.

The main focus of the second phase of my No Google life was to either switch away from running Android on my mobile device, or move away from using the Google Play store. Before I discuss that I will talk about how I am finding using non-Google apps.

One of the main app changes was the browser. Switching from Chrome to Firefox wasn't very difficult. Firefox, like most browsers these days, has a built in developers console, and also provides a sync feature for your history, open tabs, passwords, and settings. The settings sync doesn't appear to work unfortunately, but the history and open tabs are what I use it for. Before switching I didn't realise that there is no 64-bit Firefox for Windows. This surprised me. Instead I installed [name of browser](){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} on my Windows machine.



##### Phone

My decision to move to CyanogenMod was because I wanted a quick change over. I have been looking at SailfishOS but as the Jollo phones are no longer available I wanted to switch quickly. When I find the time I want to install SailfishOS and hopefully move off Android completely. In the meantime I needed a new phone and was looking for an Android alternative. My research came down to two options. The first was a device from OnePlus, who use their own Android based OS called Oxygen. The second was from WileyFox, who at the time shipped with CyanogenMod. My decision to opt for the WileyFox device was mainly to do with cost. Their Swift2 device has an impressive spec for under 200 pounds.

When I first got the device it was not rooted. I disabled all the Google related applications, and installed [Apotide](){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and [FDroid](){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} for downloading my applications. One thing that became apparent very quickly was that a large number of applications rely on the Google Play Services app being enabled. Some apps, such as Netflix, would not run at all without the Play Services application running, while others would not provide notifications. I attempted to live without it for a while but not having email notifications was rather annoying. For the time being I have enabled the app.
