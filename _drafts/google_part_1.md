Having always been concious of privacy I was surprised to wake up one day and realise how deep down the Google hole I had fallen. Ease of use is probably why it happened. It dawned on me that almost every app I was using on a daily basis had Google before it, all logged in from one account, and all syncing my data so that everything was seamless. I didn't like it.

I decided to write down all the applications I used on a weekly basis. In no particular order here is the list of apps:

* Search
* Authenticator App
* Mail
* Drive
* Chrome
* Calendar
* Maps
* Keep
* Chromecast
* Photos
* Translate
* Hangouts
* Android
* Youtube

At the time I also had 35GB of Google Drive storage, due to an offer when purchasing a SIM card. This offer was due to run out and drop me back down to the default amount of 15GB. As a fairly heavy user I needed the extra space, so I figured it was a good time to start looking around. While I was looking for alternative storage I decided to see how easy it would be to replace all the Google applications currently used.

Over a couple of days I started investigating some alternatives. I'm not going to list all the alternatives I found and tested, I may do some smaller posts if anybody is interested.

The following are the replacements I have settled on (in the same order as the list above):

Replacements
* [DuckDuckGo](#duckduckgo)
* [Authy](#authy)
* [Protonmail](#protonmail)
* [Mega](#mega)
* [Firefox](#firefox)
* [?](#calendar)
* [Waze/Citymapper](#waze)
* [Evernote](#evernote)
* [?](#cast)
* [Nothing](#photos) - only used for Chromecast background
* [?](#translator)
* [Whatsapp/Telegram](#whatsapp)
* [CynagenMod](#cynagenmod) (trying SailfishOS)
* [Youtube](#youtube) without logging in
