<p>Powerzone is the only metal radio show of its kind in the UK!  Playing the most brutal metal on British airwaves, you won't find another show like it.</p>
<p>As a long time friend of the host Dani "The Gentleman of Metal", and occasional guest, I was asked if I would like to help out by interviewing bands when they visit London.  How could I say no?!  Known as "The Beard" on air, I have started gathering contacts in the music industry and interviewing artists.  I'm always happy for feedback so please get in touch and let me know what you think!</p>
<p>Powerzone is aired on <a href='http://calonfm.com' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CalonFM</a> every Monday from 21:00 UTC. Get in touch with The Gentleman of Metal on <a href="https://twitter.com/powerzonemetal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">twitter</a> or <a href="https://facebook.com/powerzonemetal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">facebook</a>.</p>
